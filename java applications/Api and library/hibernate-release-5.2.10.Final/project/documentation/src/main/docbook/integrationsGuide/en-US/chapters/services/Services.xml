    <title>Services and Registries</title>

    <para>
        Services and registries are new *as a formalized concept* starting in 4.0.  But the functionality provided by
        the different Services have actually been around in Hibernate much, much longer.  What is new is managing them,
        their lifecycles and dependencies through a lightweight, dedicated container we call a ServiceRegistry.  The
        goal of this guide is to describe the design and purpose of these Services and Registries, as well as to look at
        details of their implementations where appropriate.  It will also delve into the ways third-party integrators and
        applications can leverage and customize Services and Registries.

        <title>What is a Service?</title>

        <para>
            A services provides a certain types of functionality, in a pluggable manner.  Specifically they are
            interfaces defining certain functionality and then implementations of those service contract interfaces.
            The interface is known as the service role; the implementation class is known as the service implementation.
            The pluggability comes from the fact that the service implementation adheres to contract defined by the
            interface of the service role and that consumers of the service program to the service role, not the
            implementation.
        </para>

        <para>
            Generally speaking, users can plug in alternate implementations of all standard service roles (overriding);
            they can also define additional services beyond the base set of service roles (extending).
        </para>

        <para>
            Let's look at an example to better define what a Service is.  Hibernate needs to be able to access
            JDBC Connections to the database.  The way it obtains and releases these Connections is through the
            ConnectionProvider service.  The service is defined by the interface (service role)
            <interfacename>org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.connections.spi.ConnectionProvider</interfacename> which declares
            methods for obtaining and releasing the Connections.  There are then multiple implementations of that
            service contract, varying in how they actually manage the Connections.
        </para>

        <para>
            Internally Hibernate always references <interfacename>org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.connections.spi.ConnectionProvider</interfacename>
            rather than specific implementations in consuming the service (we will get to producing the service later
            when we talk about registries).  Because of that fact, other ConnectionProvider service implementations
            could easily be plugged in.
        </para>

        <para>
            There is nothing revolutionary here; programming to interfaces is generally accepted as good programming
            practice.  What's interesting is the ServiceRegistry and the pluggable swapping of the different implementors.

            <title>Service contracts</title>

            <para>
                The basic requirement for a service is to implement the marker interface
                <interfacename>org.hibernate.service.Service</interfacename>.  Hibernate uses this internally for some
                basic type safety.

                The service can also implement a number of optional life-cycle related contracts:

                <para>
                    Any method on the service implementation class accepting a single parameter and annotated with
                    @<interfacename>InjectService</interfacename> is considered requesting injection of another service.
                </para>
                <para>
                    By default the type of the method parameter is expected to be the service role to be injected.  If the
                    parameter type is different than the service role, the <methodname>serviceRole</methodname> attribute
                    of the <interfacename>InjectService</interfacename> annotation should be used to explicitly name the role.
                </para>
                <para>
                    By default injected services are considered required, that is the start up will fail if a named
                    dependent service is missing.  If the service to be injected is optional, the
                    <methodname>required</methodname> attribute of the <interfacename>InjectService</interfacename>
                    annotation should be declared as <literal>false</literal> (default is <literal>true</literal>).

                <para>
                    The second approach is a pull approach where the service implements the optional service interface
                    <interfacename>org.hibernate.service.spi.ServiceRegistryAwareService</interfacename> which declares
                    a single <methodname>injectServices</methodname> method.  During startup, Hibernate will inject the
                    <interfacename>org.hibernate.service.ServiceRegistry</interfacename> itself into services which
                    implement this interface.  The service can then use the <interfacename>ServiceRegistry</interfacename>
                    reference to locate any additional services it needs.

        <title>What is a ServiceRegistry?</title>

        <para>
            A ServiceRegistry, at its most basic, hosts and manages Services.  Its contract is defined by the
            <interfacename>org.hibernate.service.ServiceRegistry</interfacename> interface.
        </para>

        <para>
            We already gave a basic overview and definition of services.  But services have other interesting
            characteristics as well.  Services have a lifecycle.  They have a scope.  Services might depend on other
            services.  And they need to be produced (choose using one implementation over another).  The ServiceRegistry
            fulfills all these needs.
        </para>

        <para>
            In a concise definition, the ServiceRegistry acts as a inversion-of-control (IoC) container.
        </para>

        <note>
            <para>
                Despite some recent revisionist history, Spring did not invent IoC nor dependency injection nor were
                they even the first to bring it into Java.  Projects like JBoss MicroContainer and Apache Avalon
                pre-date Spring by many years and each did IoC and dependency injection.  The concepts in ServiceRegistry
                are actually very similar to Apache Avalon.
            </para>
        </note>

        <para>
            Why not just use an existing IoC framework?  The main reason was that this had to be as light-weight and as
            small of a footprint as possible.  The initial design also had called for Services to be swappable at runtime,
            which unfortunately had to be removed due to performance problems in the proxy-based swapping-solution; the
            plan is to investigate alternate ways to achieve swap-ability with better performance at a later date.
        </para>

        <para>
            A Service is associated with a ServiceRegistry.  The ServiceRegistry scopes the Service.  The
            ServiceRegistry manages the lifecycle of the Service.  The ServiceRegistry handles injecting dependencies
            into the Service (actually both a pull and a push/injection approach are supported).  ServiceRegistries are
            also hierarchical, meaning a ServiceRegistry can have a parent ServiceRegistry.  Services in one registry
            can depend on and utilize services in that same registry as well as any parent registries.

                    This service defines Hibernate's ability to interact with ClassLoaders.  The manner in which
                    Hibernate (or any library) should interact with ClassLoaders varies based on the runtime environment
                    which is hosting the application.  Application servers, OSGi containers, and other modular class
                    loading systems impose very specific class-loading requirements.  This service is provides
                    Hibernate an abstraction from this environmental complexity.  And just as importantly, it does so

                                The integrator may be discovered, leveraging the standard Java ServiceLoader
                                capability provided by the ClassLoaderService.  Integrators would simply define a file
                                named <filename>/META-INF/services/org.hibernate.integrator.spi.Integrator</filename>
                                and make it available on the classpath.  ServiceLoader covers the format of this file
                                in detail, but essentially it lists classes by FQN that implement Integrator one

                    Think of this as the "short naming" service.  Historically to configure Hibernate users would
                    often need to give FQN references to internal Hibernate classes.  Of course this has caused lots
                    of problems as we refactor internal code and move these classes around into different package
                    structures.  Enter the concept of short-naming, using a well defined and well known "short name"
                    for the strategy/implementation class.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The short name mappings in this service can be managed, even by applications and integrators
                    which can be very powerful.  For more information on this aspect, see:

                main Hibernate ServiceRegistry, building on the BootstrapServiceRegistry (BootstrapServiceRegistry is

                it holds most of the Services used by Hibernate.  For the full list of Services typically held in the

                    for when the SessionFactoryServiceRegistry needs to be built.

            <title>Custom Service Implementations (overriding)</title>
            <para>
                We discussed swappability of service implementations above.  Lets look at an example in practice.
                For the sake of illustration, lets say that we have developed a new ConnectionProvider integrating
                with the wonderful new latest-and-greatest connection pooling library.  Let's look at the steps
                necessary to make that happen.
            </para>
            <para>
                The first step is to develop the actual integration by implementing the ConnectionProvider contract.
            </para>
            <example>
                <title>Custom ConnectionProvider implementation</title>
                <programlisting role="JAVA"><xi:include href="extras/override/LatestAndGreatestConnectionProviderImpl.java" parse="text" /></programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>
                At this point we have a decision about how to integrate this new ConnectionProvider into Hibernate.
                As you might guess, there are multiple ways.
            </para>
            <para>
                As a first option, we might just require that the code bootstrapping the StandardServiceRegistry do
                the integration.
            </para>
            <example>
                <title>Overriding service implementation via StandardServiceRegistryBuilder</title>
                <programlisting role="JAVA"><xi:include href="extras/override/ex1-direct.java" parse="text" /></programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>
                A second option, if our LatestAndGreatestConnectionProviderImpl should always be used, would be to
                provide a <interfacename>org.hibernate.service.spi.ServiceContributor</interfacename> implementation
                as well to handle the integration on the users behalf.
            </para>
            <example>
                <title>LatestAndGreatestConnectionProviderImplContributor</title>
                <programlisting role="JAVA"><xi:include href="extras/override/ex2-contributor.java" parse="text" /></programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>
                We still need to be able to tell Hibernate to perform this integration for us.  To do that we leverage
                Java's ServiceLoader.  When building the StandardServiceRegistry, Hibernate will look for JDK
                service providers of type <interfacename>org.hibernate.service.spi.ServiceContributor</interfacename>
                and automatically integrate them.  We discussed this behavior above.  Here we'd define a classpath
                resource named <filename>META-INF/services/org.hibernate.service.spi.ServiceContributor</filename>.
                This file will have just a single line naming our impl.
            </para>
            <example>
                <title>META-INF/services/org.hibernate.service.spi.ServiceContributor</title>
                <programlisting><xi:include href="extras/override/ex2-meta-inf" parse="text" /></programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>
                A third option, if we simply want to make our LatestAndGreatestConnectionProviderImpl available
                as a configuration choice, we would again use a ServiceContributor but in a slightly
                different way.
            </para>
            <example>
                <title>LatestAndGreatestConnectionProviderImplContributor</title>
                <programlisting role="JAVA"><xi:include href="extras/override/ex3-contributor.java" parse="text" /></programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>
                That all allows the appication to pick our LatestAndGreatestConnectionProviderImpl by a short-name.
            </para>
            <example>
                <title>Custom service short-name</title>
                <programlisting role="JAVA"><xi:include href="extras/override/ex3-app.java" parse="text" /></programlisting>

        <section xml:id="services-extending">
            <title>Custom Service Roles (extending)</title>
            <para>
                We can also have the ServiceRegistry host custom services (completely new Service roles).  As an example,
                let's say our application publishes Hibernate events to a JMS Topic and that we want to leverage the
                Hibernate ServiceRegistry to host a Service representing our publishing of events.  So we will expand the
                ServiceRegistry to host this completely new Service role for us and manage its lifecycle.
            </para>

            <example>
                <title>The EventPublishingService service role</title>
                <programlisting role="JAVA"><xi:include href="extras/extend/EventPublishingService.java" parse="text" /></programlisting>

                <programlisting role="JAVA"><xi:include href="extras/extend/EventPublishingServiceImpl.java" parse="text" /></programlisting>
            </example>

            <example>
                <title>An alternative EventPublishingService implementation</title>
                <programlisting role="JAVA"><xi:include href="extras/extend/EventPublishingServiceImpl.java" parse="text" /></programlisting>
            </example>

            <para>
                Because we have alternative implementations, it is a good idea to develop an initiator as well
                that can choose between them at runtime.
            </para>

            <example>
                <title>The EventPublishingServiceInitiator</title>
                <programlisting role="JAVA"><xi:include href="extras/extend/EventPublishingServiceInitiator.java" parse="text" /></programlisting>
            </example>

            <para>
                We could have the application register the EventPublishingServiceInitiator with the
                StandardServiceRegistryBuilder, but it is much nicer to write a ServiceContributor to handle this
                for the application.
