= 5.2 Migration Guide
:toc:

This guide discusses migration from Hibernate ORM version 5.1 to version 5.2.  For migration from
earlier versions, see any other pertinent migration guides as well.

== Background

Lots of work has been done for 6.0.  One of the things 6.0 will need is a unified view of "type systems"
including its own type system (Type, EntityPersister, CollectionPersister, etc) and JPA's type system - which
would mean unifying all of this in hibernate-core.  Because of this and the other large changes slated for 6.0
we decided to release a 5.2 that showed a clear migration path to the changes in 6.0 but that still supported the
older calls and expectations as much as possible.


== Move to Java 8 for baseline

Hibernate 5.2 is built using Java 8 JDK and will require Java 8 JRE at runtime (we are investigating whether
Java 9 will also work).  This has a number of implications:

* The hibernate-java8 module has been merged into hibernate-core and the Java 8 date/time types are now natively
	supported.
* (todo) support for Java 8 Optional
* (todo) support for other Java 8 features?


== hibernate-entitymanager merged into hibernate-core

The hibernate-entitymanager module has also been merged into hibernate-core.

* `org.hibernate.SessionFactory` now extends `javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory` - temporarily it
	technically extends `org.hibernate.jpa.HibernateEntityManagerFactory` (which in turn extends
	`javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory`) for backwards compatibility.  `HibernateEntityManagerFactory`
	is deprecated.
* `org.hibernate.Session` now extends `javax.persistence.EntityManager` - temporarily it
	technically extends `org.hibernate.jpa.HibernateEntityManager` (which in turn extends
	`javax.persistence.EntityManager`) for backwards compatibility.  `HibernateEntityManager` is deprecated.
* `org.hibernate.Query` (deprecated in favor of new `org.hibernate.query.Query`) now extends the JPA contracts
	`javax.persistence.Query` and `javax.persistence.TypedQuery`.  `ProcedureCall` and `StoredProcedureQuery` as well.
* `org.hibernate.HibernateException` now extends `javax.persistence.PersistenceExceptions`.  Hibernate methods
	that "override" methods from their JPA counterparts now will also throw various JDK defined RuntimeExceptions
	(such as `IllegalArgumentException`, `IllegalStateException`, etc) as required by the JPA contract.
* Persister/type access is now exposed through `org.hibernate.Metamodel`, which extends
	`javax.persistence.metamodel.Metamodel`.  MetamodelImpl now manages all aspects of type system (see below).
* Cache management has also been consolidated.  `org.hibernate.Cache` now extends `javax.persistence.Cache`.  CacheImpl
	now manages all aspects of cache regions (see below).


== SessionFactory hierarchy cleanup

As part of merging hibernate-entitymanager into hibernate-core, I also wanted to take a moment to clean up
some of these very old contracts,  In conjunction with the move to Java 8 (default methods) and needing to
implement JPA methods now in core I decided to implement more of a composition approach here, thus:

* SessionFactoryImplementor used to have a number of methods pertaining to managing and accessing entity and collection persisters.
	Since we need to deal with JPA Metamodel contract anyway, I went ahead and moved all of that code into our new
	`org.hibernate.metamodel.spi.MetamodelImplementor`
* SessionFactory and SessionFactoryImplementor each had a number of methods dealing with cache regions.
	Many of these methods have been deprecated since 5.0 and those will be removed.  However, the functionality
	has been moved into the `org.hibernate.Cache` and `org.hibernate.engine.spi.CacheImplementor` contracts
	helping implement JPA's `javax.persistence.Cache` role.

== LimitHandler changes

In Hibernate 4.3, dialect implementations that did not support a limit offset would fetch all rows for a query and
perform pagination in-memory.  This solution, while functional, could have severe performance penalties.  In 5.x,
we preferred to favor performance optimizations which meant dialect implementations would throw an exception if a
limit offset was specified but the dialect didn't support such syntax.

As of 5.2.5.Final, we have introduced a new setting, `hibernate.legacy_limit_handler`, that is designed to allow
users to enable the legacy 4.3 limit handler behavior.  By default, this setting is _false_.

The specific dialects impacted by this change are restricted to the following.

* Cache71Dialect
* DB2390Dialect
* InformixDialect
* IngresDialect
* RDMSOS2200Dialect
* SQLServerDialect
* TimesTenDialect

NOTE: If a dialect that extends any in the above list but overrides the limit handler implementation, then those
dialects remain unchanged, e.g. SQLServer2005Dialect.


== Misc

* QueryCacheFactory contract changed
* RegionFactory contract changes
* todo : merge AvailableSettings together
* org.hibernate.Transaction now extends JPA's EntityTransaction and follows its pre- and post- assertions.
	e.g. begin() now throws an exception if transaction is already active.
* (todo) following the above one, JPA also says that only PersistenceUnitTransactionType#JTA EntityManagers
	are allowed to access EntityTransactions.  Need a strategy to handle this
* Session#getFlushMode and Query#getFlushMode clash in terms of Hibernate (FlushMode) and JPA (FlushModeType)
	returns.  #getFlushMode has been altered to return JPA's FlushModeType.  The Hibernate FlushMode
	is still available via #getHibernateFlushMode and #setHibernateFlushMode.  Same for Session#getFlushMode
	and EntityManager#getFlushMode.
* Setting `hibernate.listeners.envers.autoRegister` has been deprecated in favor of
  `hibernate.envers.autoRegisterListeners`.
* AuditReader#getCurrentRevision has been deprecated in favor of `org.hibernate.envers.RevisionListener`.
