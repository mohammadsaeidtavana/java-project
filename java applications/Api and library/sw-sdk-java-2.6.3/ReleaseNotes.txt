    * Remove dependancy on external XML parser by embedding
      a very lightweight parser along with the library.
      Shrunk the final swsms.jar file by 90% which also
      has improved performance.
      
    * Fixed debug bug where debug output was always printed
      out -- now it is toggled with the setDebugMode property.
      
    * Added getVersion, getMajorVersion, getMinorVersion,
      and getRevisionVersion to help determine which version
      of the SMS library is being used.
      
    * Added support for specifying the source and destination
      ports of the message.  On a GSM network, this would
      be added to the User Data Header.
      
    * Added WAP push support.

2.5.1 - July 13, 2003

      one for proxy access.  The property is now automatically
      pulled from the proxy during the authentication process.
      
    * Removed ThreadGroup (EJB context only) bug which caused 
      a security exception to be thrown.

    * Removed HTTPClient dependency by adding own HTTP
      implementation.

    * Reused XML parser between Send() method calls which
      dramatically increased performance during bulk sending of

      optimizations throughout the entire package.
