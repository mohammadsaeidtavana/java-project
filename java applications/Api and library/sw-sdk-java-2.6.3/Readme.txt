In order to send live messages to actual mobile devices from 
your Developer Account, you must purchase Demo Messages, in the
form of credits, on the Simplewire Wireless Messaging Network.
Please note that Demo Messages will include the "Simplewire 
Evaluation" tag at the beginning of each message. All remaining
Demo Message Credits will be automatically transferred to your 
commercial account when you Go Live! In order to purchase Demo
Message Credits, login to Your Account at
